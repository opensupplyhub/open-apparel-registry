            Hi,
        </p>
        <p>
            You're receiving this email because we revoked your request to claim this
            Open Supply Hub facility:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Facility: {{ facility_name }}, {{ facility_address }}, {{ facility_country }}
            </li>
            <li>
                Facility URL: <a href="{{ facility_url }}">{{ facility_url }}</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        {% if revocation_reason|length %}
        <p>
            Here's the reason for it was revoked:
        </p>
        <p>
            {{ revocation_reason }}
        </p>
        {% endif %}
        <p>
            We have discovered your claim is actually inaccurate. If you believe your claim
            should not have been revoked, you can reach out to the OS Hub team to provide additional,
            clarifying information at: <a href="mailto:info@opensupplyhub.org">info@opensupplyhub.org</a>.
            The team will review your claim and get back to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Best wishes,
        </p>
