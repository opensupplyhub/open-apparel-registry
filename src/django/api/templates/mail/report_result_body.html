            Hi there,
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for reporting {{ facility_name }} facility as {{ closure_state|lower }}.
            {% if is_closure and is_rejected %}We have rejected this report and the facility's profile in OS Hub has not been changed.{% endif %}{% if is_closure and is_confirmed %}The facility profile in Open Supply Hub has now been updated and the facility is marked as closed.{% endif %}{% if is_reopening and is_rejected %}We have rejected this report and the facility's profile in OS Hub has not been changed.{% endif %}{% if is_reopening and is_confirmed %}The facility profile in Open Supply Hub has now been updated and the facility is no longer marked as closed.{% endif %}

        </p>
        {% endif %}
        {% if is_rejected %}
        <p>
            If you have additional evidence that can be used to verify the facility has {{ closure_state|lower }}, this can be shared with: info@opensupplyhub.org
        </p>
        {% endif %}
        {% if is_closure and is_confirmed %}
        <p>
            Should you receive reports that the facility is re-opened in the future, you can share this update with the OS Hub Team.
        </p>
